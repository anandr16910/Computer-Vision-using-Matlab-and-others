# some commonly used matlab commands and functions in computer vision and also with regards to object localization and detection.

Here are commonly used MATLAB commands and functions for computer vision, with emphasis on object localization and detection, grouped by task area for quick scanning.[^1]

### Image I/O and basics

- imread, imwrite, imshow for loading, saving, and visualizing images.[^1]
- videoReader, vision.VideoFileReader, vision.DeployableVideoPlayer for video pipelines and playback in apps or scripts.[^1]
- rgb2gray, imresize, imcrop, imrotate, imgaussfilt, medfilt2, imadjust for routine pre-processing before detection.[^1]


### Feature detection and matching

- detectSURFFeatures, detectHarrisFeatures, detectFASTFeatures for keypoints in classical pipelines.[^1]
- extractFeatures, matchFeatures to build correspondences for alignment, tracking, or geometric verification.[^1]
- estimateGeometricTransform2D, imwarp for alignment and homography-based localization.[^1]


### Segmentation and region measurements

- imbinarize, edge, imopen, imclose, bwlabel, bwconncomp for quick object proposals via morphology.[^1]
- regionprops, regionprops3 to get bounding boxes, centroids, area for localization from binary masks.[^1]
- activecontour, superpixels, imsegkmeans for mask-level localization setups.[^1]


### Ground truth labeling and datasets

- imageLabeler, videoLabeler apps for bounding boxes, polygons, attributes; export to groundTruth object for training.[^1]
- groundTruth, objectDetectorTrainingData, groundTruth.gatherLabelData to convert labels into datastores used by detectors.[^1]
- splitEachLabel, combine, transform for managing datastores and splits before training/evaluation.[^1]


### Classical detectors (non-deep learning)

- vision.CascadeObjectDetector (Viola–Jones) for faces, eyes, profiles as a fast baseline.[^1]
- peopleDetectorACF, trainACFObjectDetector for Aggregate Channel Features pedestrian/face detectors.[^1]
- vision.ForegroundDetector, imabsdiff, opticalFlowLK for motion-based localization in video.[^1]


### Deep learning object detectors

- yolov4ObjectDetector to define YOLOv4 detectors; supports pretrained backbones via add-ons.[^1]
- trainYOLOv4ObjectDetector to train or fine-tune a YOLOv4 model from groundTruth data.[^1]
- detect(detector, I) to run inference returning bboxes, scores, labels; input auto-resizing built-in.[^1]
- ssdObjectDetector, fasterRCNNObjectDetector, trainSSDObjectDetector, trainFasterRCNNObjectDetector for SSD and Faster R-CNN workflows when preferred over YOLO.[^1]
- evaluateObjectDetection, evaluateDetectionPrecision, evaluateDetectionAOS to compute mAP, PR curves, and alignment-based metrics on labeled datasets.[^1]


### Training utilities and options

- trainingOptions (sgdm, adam, etc.) to set MaxEpochs, MiniBatchSize, learning rates, and plots with training-progress.[^1]
- augmentedImageDatastore, transform training data with on-the-fly augmentation for better generalization.[^1]
- experiment manager integration and training info plotting (plot(info.TrainingLoss)) for monitoring.[^1]


### Visualization and annotation

- insertObjectAnnotation for drawing rectangles and labels on images after detection.[^1]
- labeloverlay for mask overlays when doing instance/semantic segmentation localization.[^1]
- montage, rectangle, text for quick visual summaries of results and samples.[^1]


### Evaluation and analysis

- evaluateDetectionPrecision to get AP, PR; evaluateObjectDetection for end-to-end evaluation tied to groundTruth.[^1]
- confusionchart for per-class analysis when converting detections into confusion matrices on matched results.[^1]
- writetable, readtable to export detection results (bboxes, scores, labels) to CSV for cross-tool analysis.[^1]


### 3D, calibration, and multi-view (when localization needs geometry)

- estimateCameraParameters, cameraCalibrator app for intrinsic/extrinsic calibration.[^1]
- triangulate, relativeCameraPose, bundleAdjustment for multi-view localization.[^1]
- disparitySGM, reconstructScene for stereo-based depth aiding object localization in 3D.[^1]


### Apps for end-to-end workflows

- Image Labeler and Video Labeler to annotate boxes, polygons, attributes; automate labeling with built-in algorithms.[^1]
- Object Detector Training app to configure and train YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN without hand-written loops.[^1]


### Minimal code patterns (object detection)

- Training YOLOv4:
    - data = load("vehicleDatasetGroundTruth.mat"); options = trainingOptions("sgdm", ...);.[^1]
    - net = yolov4ObjectDetector("darknet53-coco"); detector, info = trainYOLOv4ObjectDetector(data.groundTruth, net, options);.[^1]
- Inference and visualization:
    - [bboxes, scores, labels] = detect(detector, I); detected = insertObjectAnnotation(I, "Rectangle", bboxes, labels); imshow(detected);.[^1]
- Evaluation:
    - results = detect(detector, validationData); [ap, recall, precision] = evaluateDetectionPrecision(results, validationData);.[^1]


### When to use which detector

- YOLOv4: strong speed/accuracy tradeoff; great with integrated labeling and training in MATLAB for demos and deployment.[^1]
- SSD: efficient one-stage baseline with simpler configuration and good throughput.[^1]
- Faster R-CNN: higher accuracy on small/occluded objects with two-stage pipeline at cost of speed.[^1]
- ACF/Cascade: classical, lightweight, fast for constrained classes like faces/pedestrians without GPUs.[^1]


### Interop and deployment tips

- Use writetable to export detections for Python analysis; compare with Ultralytics/torchvision metrics if needed.[^1]
- Install Computer Vision Toolbox Model add-ons for pretrained YOLOv4 weights before fine-tuning; consider GPU for speed.[^1]
- Prefer desktop MATLAB R2025b for full GPU, codec, device access, and Simulink/codegen integration during detector work.[^1]
