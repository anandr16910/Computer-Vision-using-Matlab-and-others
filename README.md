## What is Computer Vision?
Computer vision focuses on understanding and interpreting visual content to make decisions, while image processing focuses on transforming or enhancing pixel data without semantic understanding


## Image processing and CV:
|----|---|---|
 |Aspect	|Image processing |	Computer vision|
|Primary goal|	Enhance/transform pixels |	Understand/interpret content |
Outputs	Processed image or low-level features 	Labels, boxes, masks, tracks, decisions 
Techniques	Filters, morphology, thresholding, edges 	ML/DL models, CNNs/transformers, training 
Determinism	Mostly deterministic, rule-based 	Data-driven, probabilistic 
Typical tools	OpenCV, MATLAB IPT 	PyTorch, TensorFlow, YOLO/ResNet 
Example use	Noise reduction before analysis 	Detect pedestrians/signs in driving
