# Compare MATLAB tools for semantic and instance segmentation

MATLAB provides built‑in workflows for both: semantic segmentation centers on pixel‑wise class maps via semanticseg and related networks, while instance segmentation returns per‑object masks, labels, scores, and boxes via Mask R‑CNN or SOLOv2 tooling.[^1][^2][^3]

### Core difference

- Semantic segmentation assigns a category to every pixel and outputs a label image and optional per‑pixel scores; same‑class objects are not separated.[^4][^1]
- Instance segmentation predicts a separate mask for each object along with class labels, confidence scores, and often bounding boxes; overlapping same‑class objects are distinguished.[^2][^5][^6]


### Key MATLAB functions

- Semantic: semanticseg for single images or datastores; evaluateSemanticSegmentation to compute GlobalAccuracy, MeanIoU, WeightedIoU, and MeanBFScore; helper layers like unet and deeplabv3plus for model creation.[^7][^8][^9][^1]
- Instance: maskrcnn and solov2 objects with segmentObjects for inference; examples show pretrained downloads and transfer learning, plus visualization with insertObjectMask.[^5][^6][^10][^2]


### Typical workflows

- Semantic pipeline: train or load a network (e.g., DeepLab v3+/U‑Net), run semanticseg on images or a datastore, write results to disk, then compute metrics with evaluateSemanticSegmentation and inspect class/image metrics tables.[^11][^1][^4][^7]
- Instance pipeline: load a pretrained Mask R‑CNN or SOLOv2 model, call segmentObjects to obtain masks, labels, scores, boxes, and visualize overlays; optionally fine‑tune on custom data via transfer learning.[^3][^6][^2][^5]


### Models and support packages

- Semantic models: DeepLab v3+, U‑Net, SegNet style architectures available through function constructors and examples within Computer Vision Toolbox and Deep Learning Toolbox.[^12][^8][^9]
- Instance models: Mask R‑CNN and SOLOv2 available as add‑on model packages with ready examples to run pretrained or train on custom datasets.[^6][^10][^3]


### Data labeling and evaluation

- Semantic labeling: use Image Labeler/Video Labeler to create pixelLabelDatastore, then evaluate with semanticSegmentationMetrics via evaluateSemanticSegmentation (GlobalAccuracy, MeanAccuracy, MeanIoU, WeightedIoU, MeanBFScore).[^13][^14][^7][^11]
- Instance labeling: require per‑object polygon masks; evaluate with example workflows for Mask R‑CNN/SOLOv2 that report per‑instance scores and support dataset processing through datastores.[^2][^3][^5]


### Performance and deployment

- Semanticseg supports GPU execution and batch inference on datastores, enabling throughput scaling and parallel processing via toolbox preferences.[^1][^4]
- Instance segmentation is typically heavier; SOLOv2 offers single‑stage efficiency, while Mask R‑CNN provides robust two‑stage accuracy; threshold and NMS tuning balance precision/recall.[^10][^6][^2]


### Related segmentation tooling

- Classical/interactive segmentation and SAM: MATLAB also includes classical methods (watershed, activecontour, superpixels) and Segment Anything Model utilities, which can complement or bootstrap labels for either task.[^15][^16][^17]


### Quick comparison table

| Aspect | Semantic segmentation | Instance segmentation |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Primary output | Per‑pixel class map and scores [^1] | Per‑object masks, labels, scores, boxes [^5] |
| Main APIs | semanticseg; evaluateSemanticSegmentation [^1][^7] | maskrcnn/solov2 + segmentObjects [^6][^5] |
| Typical models | U‑Net, DeepLab v3+ [^8][^9] | Mask R‑CNN, SOLOv2 [^6][^10] |
| Labeling need | Pixel class masks [^13] | Polygon masks per object [^2] |
| Metrics | Global/MeanAccuracy, MeanIoU, WeightedIoU, BF score [^7][^14] | Per‑instance scores; example workflows for dataset evaluation [^2][^3] |
| Complexity | Lower compute; no instance IDs [^4] | Higher compute; instance‑level outputs [^2] |

### Practical tips

- Choose semanticseg for scene understanding and region mapping where object identity is unnecessary; evaluate with IoU/BF score and consider DeepLab v3+ for accuracy on complex boundaries.[^8][^4][^7]
- Choose Mask R‑CNN or SOLOv2 for counting, tracking, and manipulation tasks; start with pretrained models and refine thresholds in segmentObjects to meet precision/recall targets.[^5][^10][^2]
